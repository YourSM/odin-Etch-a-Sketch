# odin-Etch-a-Sketch
This is a project for the Odin Project curriculum where I created a live Etch-and-Sketch!

The player has a variety of options, including a rainbow brush as well as a challenge mode where they are tasked with completing a grid without interacting more than 10 times with each square, which darkens with each interaction.

The player can also choose any size square they like, as long as it is 100 squares or under. The program then fills the play-space, shrinking or enlarging squares as fit.

This project highlights my skills with HTML, CSS, and using JavaScript functions and DOM manipulation, among other attributes like problem-solving and debugging.
